- We have learn how to create pop-up window
- We have learn how to create a side navbar
- We have also learnt about localStorage in javaScript
- We learnt Collaborating on GitHub and about branching and pull and push methods

## Challenges that we faced in early stages:
- We have struggled a lot while creating our own database using json data server and npm
- We faced some issues in implementing the dynamic behaviour of the webpages.
- We have were not familiar with a few of the packages like npm install, so we learnt about it and overcame the issue

## Scope of improvements in future:
- We have created only 6 pages of the website so anyone who is interested can work upon the rest of the webpages.
- We have not activated the links in the footer, so you can work upon those too.

## Purpose of this project:
- The only purpose of this project was to learn the new stuffs and deploy what we were knew.
- We are not going to publish any of these pages to anywhere 
- It was purely a practice of what we learnt till now
