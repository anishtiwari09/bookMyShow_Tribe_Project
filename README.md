## Challenges that we faced in early stages:
- We have struggled a lot while creating our own database using json data server and npm
- We faced some issues in implementing the dynamic behaviour of the webpages.
- We have were not familiar with a few of the packages like npm install, so we learnt about it and overcame the issue

## Scope of improvements in future:
- We have created only 6 pages of the website so anyone who is interested can work upon the rest of the webpages.
- We have not activated the links in the footer, so you can work upon those too.
